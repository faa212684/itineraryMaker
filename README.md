# Itinerary Maker
As apart of our final project, we have decided to make an itinerary maker that takes two inputs, location and method of transportation, and plans an itinerary around that location. It randomly sources places for two nearby attractions, and three places for food, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It works the best in big cities, but theoretically should work for all places that has google maps.

## Instructions
Currently, it is hosted at http://moe.stuy.edu/~kwang30/fp/ and http://moe.stuy.edu/~szheng31/fp/ , but is subject to change when Stuy no longer wants to host it. It does require an apache server to run, but we will probably migrate the project to flask or django in the future. Also, it does require a google maps API key with places, directions, and geocoding enabled, which you can replace in script.py.
